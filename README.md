# mini-llamacpp
Trying to implement an inference engine for educational purposes. Over time, this project should closely resemble the extremely popular LlamaCPP (https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). All credits to the LlamaCPP folks.

Quick Note: Started adding a lot of code comments because I might not be able to come back to this project as often as I expected.
